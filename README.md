## 3. Game Rules

In this game, players combine tiles with the same numbers until they reach the value of ***2048***.  
Tiles contain integer values starting from ***2 or 4***, which are powers of 2, such as ***2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, etc.***

### 3.2. Game Settings

- Players can enable/disable the ***undo/redo*** mode and adjust the 2048 game board size. If not configured initially, the ***undo/redo*** function is ***disabled*** by default, and the board size is set to ***4 x 4***.

<div align="center">
  <img src="images/a5.png" alt="a5">
</div>

- When the undo/redo function is enabled, players can ***revert to previous moves*** during gameplay. Attempting to undo beyond the initial state will result in an error.

<div align="center">
  <img src="images/c2.png" alt="c2">
</div>

- Similarly, redo allows players to ***return to states undone***. If all undone states are redone, further redo attempts will result in an error. Additionally, if any move is made between undo and redo, redo becomes unavailable, resulting in an error.

<div align="center">
  <img src="images/c3.png" alt="c3">
</div>

- When the ***undo/redo*** function is ***enabled***, both undo and redo are allowed. The notification is as follows:

<div align="center">
  <img src="images/c5.png" alt="c5">
</div>

- When only the ***undo*** function is enabled, ***redo*** is not allowed. The notification is as follows:

<div align="center">
  <img src="images/c4.png" alt="c4">
</div>

- If this section is not configured, the undo/redo function remains ***disabled***. The notification is as follows:

- A valid password must not be ***empty*** (i.e., no blank input).  

- Failed login attempts will display error messages:
